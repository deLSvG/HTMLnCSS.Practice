    <h1>
        ACT 1
    </h1>

    <h2>
        PROLOGUE
    </h2>
    
    <span>Two households, both alike in dignity,</span>
    <span>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</span>
    <span>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</span>
    <span>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</span>
    <span>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</span>
    <span>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</span>
    <span>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</span>
    <span>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</span>
    <span>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</span>
    <span>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</span>
    <span>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</span>
    <span>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</span>
    <span>The which if you with patient ears attend,</span>
    <span>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</span>
